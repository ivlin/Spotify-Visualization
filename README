The csv data files are all stored in /static
“pca.py” contains the script for preprocessing the data. 
“pca_reduction.csv” contains the information of the components generated by PCA
"spotify.csv" contains the original dataset
"spotify_numeric.csv" contains just the numeric attributes
“spotify_numeric_norm.csv” stores the processed numeric attributes.

## Background

This is a visualization project for a collection of datasets on Spotify songs obtained from Kaggle.com. The visualizations are performed using D3, but outside of this, the interface is solely vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
